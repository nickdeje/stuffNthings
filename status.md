Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far I have created a private server, then accessed the discord developer portal to create an 'application' and a 'bot'.
I then added this bot to my server or 'guild', then used python to create a connection between discord and the program
using the discord library, which is a library used for creating apps that use the discord API. Next I have searched through the documentation 
in order to gain a grasp of how to respond to user input(events) along with gain a grasp of some of the utility functions 
the library has to offer.



#### What have you not done for your project yet?

The basis of the project has not been done yet, I need to write code so that when a user inputs a command (in any channel), the bot will
produce a list of the upcoming sneaker releases for the week. Also, I have to do some more research on how to connect the bot
to an external site in order to scrape information to update the bot automatically, but that is not of utmost importance right now, I just
need to get the bot working with user commands first.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I had a lot of trouble importing the discord library in order to use it in my program. I followed the tutorial on their website but it took me
quite a bit to fix the problem. For some reason it did not install directly into the python library folder as it should have, so it had to be 
moved out of the wrong folder into the correct one, then the import function began working.
