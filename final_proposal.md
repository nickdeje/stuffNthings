# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Weekly Release Monitor

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A discord bot that uses a single command to print out the weekly releases for limited edition sneakers that will have resale value.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The basis for my project will be a discord bot. The bot will be connected to my server with my friends that also resell sneakers and 
allow any user to use it in order to make their life a bit easier. This bot will activate when a user inputs a specified 
command (ie !weekly), the bot will then print out a simple list consisting of the sneakers releasing that week along 
with the release date of said sneakers. 
## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

n/a

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

n/a

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be a working discord bot that prints out a list of sneakers and release dates when given the correct command. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be to use a specific website to gather the information for the sneakers, rather than input the information manually. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be a discord bot that prints out a list of upcoming sneaker releases, a picture of the sneaker, predicted
resell prices, and a link to the sites releasing them, all automatically without manual input. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My first step is learning about how to make a discord bot using strictly python. Then I would need to learn how to format a somewhat
nice looking list for the bot to output when given the command. Lastly, if time allows I would need to research how to scrape a specific website
for specific information relating to my project, then using that information to automatically update the bot on a weekly basis so I would not have to manually
input the releases every single week. I hope to acquire basic web scraping skills, learn how to use the discord module to connect to discord, and better my python
skills overall through this project.
